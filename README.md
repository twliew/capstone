## Overview
This project addresses the inefficiencies non-profits face in volunteer recruitment, matching, and scheduling. We are designing a streamlined volunteer planning tool for UW Engineering Outreach, driven by management engineering principles, to reduce manual workload and improve engagement.

## Problem
Non-profits lack affordable, effective tools to efficiently manage volunteers, resulting in wasted time, poor volunteer experiences, and reduced community impact.

## Solution
Our tool will provide:

✅ Smart volunteer matching based on availability, skills, and preferences

📅 Easy scheduling and event management

🔒 Privacy-focused data handling (especially for minors)

🖥️ Simple, accessible user interface

## Implementation (Done - Iteration 1)

1. Scoring Algorithm (scores based on relevant skills and past experiences)
2. Scheduling optimization (reads availability based on selected applicants)
