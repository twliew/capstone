## Overview
This project addresses the inefficiencies non-profits face in volunteer recruitment, matching, and scheduling. We are designing a streamlined volunteer planning tool for UW Engineering Outreach, driven by management engineering principles, to reduce manual workload and improve engagement.

## Problem
Non-profits lack affordable, effective tools to efficiently manage volunteers, resulting in wasted time, poor volunteer experiences, and reduced community impact.

## Solution
Our tool will provide:

✅ Smart volunteer matching based on availability, skills, and preferences

📅 Easy scheduling and event management

🔒 Privacy-focused data handling (especially for minors)

🖥️ Simple, accessible user interface

## Implementation (Done - Iteration 1)

1. Scoring Algorithm (scores based on relevant skills and past experiences)
2. Scheduling optimization (reads availability based on selected applicants)

## Github Files
This Github contains the following files
1. Final STEMSelect script (Jupyter Notebook)
2. Ranking Algorithm Demo Data (csv)
4. Schedule Optimizer Demo Data (csv)
5. Ranking Algorithm Demo Output (csv)
6. Schedule Optimizer Demo Output (xlsx)
